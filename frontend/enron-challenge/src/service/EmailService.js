Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really can't afford to lend any.  The cash that I received recently represents 80% of the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash with any degree of certainty.  Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this money for at least 6 months.\n\nb) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28.  The new company deal that Enron is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not be \ndone until the month.  If this deal falls through, then I have to find a job with another company.  In this case, it is most likely that I will have to move back to the \nUS since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared the the new Enron deal) are there.\n\nc) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to the bank mortgage.  With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a mortgage at\n4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material enough.\n\nd) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank through a mortgage.  It is very beneficial for later on in life.  Paying visa bills does help you a bit in this\ncategory, but not like a mortgage.\n\n\nHopefully, you can get the financing from a bank.  I think that this is the best solution in the long run.  \n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLivia_Zufferli@Monitor.com@ENRON  \nSent:\tMonday, January 07, 2002 12:54 PM\nTo:\tZufferli, John\nSubject:\t \n\nHi John,\n\nWanted to talk to you about the house stuff.  Dad told me that he was\ntalking to you about financing options.  I just wanted to say that I don't\nwant you to feel compelled to write a mortgage for me -- dad's just trying\nto explore different options.  I know it's a lot of cash, and I would never\nwant to impose on you.  I'm sure that I can get a mortgage from the bank at\na decent rate, as long as I can put down the 25% down payment so that I can\navoid the mortgage insurance, which is costly.  I'm cashing in some GICs\nand other bonds, and Ali's going to lend me $10K, so I will be able to come\nup with the $55K for the down payment.\n\nIf writing the mortgage is something that you would like to do for a stable\ninvestment, then we can talk too.  My time horizon on the condo is 5-7\nyears, so i recognize that that would hold up your capital for a long\nwhile.  Anyway, I have to go ahead and get the guarantee of financing\nwithin 5 days or so, so I have to make a decision in the next day either\nway.  Maybe you can call, or email me?\n\nLivia\n"},
